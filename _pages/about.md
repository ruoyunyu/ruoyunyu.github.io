Hello everyone! My name is Ruoyun Yu. I am currently a second-year Master of Philosophy student in Logic at Nanjing University, China. Recently, I further broadened my academic horizons as an exchange student at the University of California, Berkeley.

My primary research interests lie in the philosophy of language and logic. I have a particular focus on the exploration of speech acts, especially assertion, and propositional attitudes.

Having completed my Bachelor of Philosophy at Nanjing University, I am proud to have been recognized as the Outstanding Graduate of the Department of Philosophy and the recipient of the Undergraduate Excellent Graduation Thesis award.

Aside from my research, I am passionate about promoting cross-disciplinary dialogue in philosophy and actively encouraging discussion around underrepresented philosophical traditions. My dedication to philosophy extends beyond personal study, reflecting a commitment to making this discipline accessible, diverse, and globally relevant.

Please let me know if any other adjustments are needed.
